**Just Delete Component**

------------------------------------

A simple add-on to "get blender to just instantly delete the selected face/vert/edge/object etc rather than pop up that not-always-welcome menu"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install and Enable the add-on. Press 'Delete' to just delete the current selection.

Maybe there are easier ways for doing that: not sure!
